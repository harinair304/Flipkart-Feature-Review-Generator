So I have used this phone for 15 days without giving any rest to it, and it becomes my darling now it never hangs atleast once throughout, and i heavily used both front and rear camera, camera was excellent, but in dim lights definitely photo quality is poor, samsung is good even in dim lights, but Samsung will hangs a lot, comes to gaming it's a Masterpiece, even a higher hand games will play like a butter even in max graphics settings, over 3g battery will drain fastly, but still you can use 3g continiously with gaming for more than 10 hours, overall it's excellent, Probably the best phone in this price segment....it offers a lot at this price point...charging time has also come down a lot.....it takes 1 hour 30 minutes to charge the phone....one word for this phone....it is incredibly awesome....looks quite attractive in hand....fingprint scanner is blazing fast in this phone....overall 9/10 for this product....a nice product from xiaomi..... As per price range phone was killer The excellent output from the 3.5mm jack, all you need is a good pair of earphone.I faced product hang issue.It becomes very hot while we charged the phone.look and other features are good.The fingerprint scanner also works well and this phone is a good value for money.Good budged phone with nice performance You get almost everything a smartphone user needs without the help of any third-party apps.And the phone still runs lollipop, how can a company this big not be able to debug it's skin in two years?phone in not much loaded yet so can't say about the processor speed but till now its good.I can say one thing that I surely bought a much better piece than iphone....a must buy phone...display quality and speakers are awesome...camera is good in every situation which is the most promising feature of this phone....go for it @ R's.But as time goes on u will find this is not at all a premium kind of phone.Almost I am using from 5 months there is no problem everything is working very well and it depends on price ho much paying so In a such price we can not find such fantastic phone Good phone, worth of money you paid Only thing we have to be cautious about radiation....Chinese and other low cost smart phone gives great camera and.Below I have written my own observation and experience with this phone within a short span of one month (although I know it might be too early ;p ) First things first, the look of the phone is amazing (Gold color).

If anyone is looking for a budget smartphone with a Flagship like performance then don't think twice, just go for it, you will never get disappointed with your purchase.If you can do with the mediocre low light photography and the fixed internal memory(considering that you will use SIM in both slots), no other phone comes close to what Mi Note 3 offers.don't listen to bad reviews and definitely buy this phone 1.most of the people don't known that redmi note 3 can be undated to any upcoming versions of android once the xiaomi sends you the update after testing it xiaomi may take time to send you the update but it will be definitely send you whereas other companies phones have a upgradedation limit and and like apple redmi xioumi updates all the phones at once so no one is left behind My previous phone was Moto x2 so i do miss that infinite contrast of amoled though.This is my first Xiaomi phone, so i expected miui to be running flawlessly on it.first of all thank you flipkart for quick and well packed delivery.now coming to phone a high end phone with a nothing price.performance wise no lags at all.even keeps high end gaming in memory.best part about the phone is its battery .it lasts me hole single day even after heavy usage.charging time is fairly quick too.charge a 4000mah battery in 2hours only.6)Regarding performance wise I took 3gb and 32 gb gold color phone.No lagging issues found.Only one Caution: The phone might start heating up while playing high graphics game.I m using this phone for last 9 days and i have to say that this phone got everything you need using from last 8 months but having no issues, if anyone want to buy a phone in price range of 12k then you can for sure choose Mi Redmi Note3 Awesome phone the phone gets fab for every update but if we use the 4g for more time the charging is draining little bit fastly after 4-5 days of the phone display and soft key not working, and i have to do quick restore .Did a lot of research, and no other smartphone could come even closer.This phone is fascinating and the configuration you get under this value is equal to other mobiles which come with a value of 20K Yellow tinge in display after 5 months of usage i recommend not to buy and the service is also very very poor will take months to repair coming with unsatisfactory results now i understood cheap phones are cheap in every aspect, 1 star is for that i cant rate it below that i will not recommend it I bet you can't find another phone with such specs and design within this range.

Only con is the camera...its really poor.... Another worse example of megapixel and clarity trade off... Only front camera and low light picture is not up to the mark, specially if you compared with Moto G 4 plus camera.Yes the camera might not be in comparison to other phones in this price bracket but those phone barely get anything else right.Except camera quality in low light.The phone is great value for money, only con i can point out is the cameras which perform very badly in low light conditions.Very poor camera quality its not worth 3.2 MP.Both cameras front and rear are of very ordinary quality.The only one thing which made me disappointed is back camera.Only one cons is the camera .Here its disappointing me.I have iPhone 6 so I dont want any other phone for camera... ->Secondary camera in both is completely blur The camera gives a high resolution picture even under moderate light conditions.Pros: battery backup, features such as infrared, fingerprint, child lock, app lock, camera But camera clearity is less than other Mi phones I had little problem with camera,where pics were getting blur,when I asked for return,as seller don't accepted return..so over phone a technician suggested to me to change camera setting,,n I did now its okay.. Nice phone... fast processing phone in low coast.... it's having large storage area..... Amazing camera quality......................

First of all thanks to Flipkart & WS Retail, actually I was trying to buy this smartphone for the last one month or so from the other website (Am....), but every-time I get disappointed, then on 1st June on the very first day of the Open sale I saw Flipkart is selling this phone and guess who was the Seller, non other than WS Retail (I can blindly trust this seller), so I just ordered the 3gb/32gb (Gold) variant and I got this smartphone within 5 days of time and packaging was good as usual.The service of Xiaomi in India is not that much good as all other big brands but still they are doing their level best to give the best, at least, they have exclusive service centers in India.3)Batter backup is good.I am using continuos for 6 hours I observed 45% battery was consumed.For normal users they can get 36 hours battery.All good but Camera ...really disappointing when its a bit low Light.This is a grate phone in this price range..it is better then le2 and Lenovo k5 because i am using all this phone ..its display quality is awasam and battery back up also ,sound qualiy also very good.siply i suggest ordered this phone and enjoy.Heard bad reviews about MIUI but i find it good enough for normal usage I am glad with this product after 4 days of use, first time I face few issue with finger sensor but the process which I have followed is wrong so tach a help from YouTube and do the same the finger sensor works good.

Flipkart customer care service is pathetic nowadays......asked me to go see a service centre....You should not sell the products if you can't exchange your faulty products.Worthless product,gone dead after seven days' use.Since then wandering from pillar to post to get service done.Service center has done nothing till date except picking the product.Every time their readymade reply-product had not been send back from head office.This is the first Xiaomi product which is such a useless n troublesome I buy Redmi note 3,but after using 2 days it show problem like overheating, when u connected to wifi or mobile data it will automatically disconnected after sometime.I complain for over heating to flipkart Customer care and they send a technician and he told me mobile is normal, don't know in which parameter he told this.I again complain to flipkart but this time they told me i need to go service center.If i have such time they why i should buy any product online (because saving our time) ...Very very bad product.Flipkart delivered the product one day before the expected date of delivery But the product was great fallen two times and there is no small scratch on it.Other wise it was great product at this price.i got faulty product, and packing is so poor.The 4 stars I've given is for the product and the 1 star which I've not given is for the really poor delivery service.I am glad with this product after 4 days of use, first time I face few issue with finger sensor but the process which I have followed is wrong so tach a help from YouTube and do the same the finger sensor works good.as technocrats are doing some foul-play doing the product review of the phone, they mention that it never heats up but they are wrong.

On the call quality front, we never faced any major call quality issues during our review of Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 - the voice reception and transmission were mostly glitch-free.So I have used this phone for 15 days without giving any rest to it, and it becomes my darling now it never hangs atleast once throughout, and i heavily used both front and rear camera, camera was excellent, but in dim lights definitely photo quality is poor, samsung is good even in dim lights, but Samsung will hangs a lot, comes to gaming it's a Masterpiece, even a higher hand games will play like a butter even in max graphics settings, over 3g battery will drain fastly, but still you can use 3g continiously with gaming for more than 10 hours, overall it's excellent, Very simple and sleek design, overall solid build quality, metal uni-body.Both phones offer a nice build quality but Le2 looks more premium and slimmer.Very nice product and good quality rich look I can say one thing that I surely bought a much better piece than iphone....a must buy phone...display quality and speakers are awesome...camera is good in every situation which is the most promising feature of this phone....go for it @ R's.Good display color, smooth interface, battery backup havey users last a day, camera quality so so, allover good phone Worth mentioning build quality, FHD 5.5 SCREEN, Battery.But a little disappointed because of the unavailability of gold colour one...actually I wanted that colour..I have to compromise with this silver one..:-(:-) features, packing and delivery was very nice...I am fully satisfied by ni note 3 features and built quality...thank u once again Flipkart and MI The sound quality is excellent.The overall built quality is great but not good in design.Build quality is good... not like iPhone but comparable to Samsung midrange phones.I went by reading reviews abt ppl saying camera s pretty decent n u don't need slr quality image from phone n stuff like tht ... Buy very first time u use the camera n u ll be absolutely disappointed .. my Moto g3 which was a year older clicked much much better images compared to this one ... Good picture quality ..I Purchased the redmi note 3 last month its really super video and camera quality very god amazing clarity all video record and camera High definition and charge capacity is good I'm daily used mobile 8 hours continues in online charge reduced 60% I'm very hpy to purchase the mobile and flipkart delivery is Very good thank u for good mobile give to me convey my thanks for flipkart

This slight elevation does help in improving the sound output in terms of loudness and quality.Low light images are of very poor quality and blurry.Super smartphone but touch pad is very poor quality 3GB ram and 1.8ghz snapdragon makes high end games look like a piece of cake and so far no lagging in between switching apps, Camera quality could have been better as i find it a little dull.Xiaomi beats all other old and big brands just because of their business model, price, quality, and MIUI.Pathetic Camera quality, highly disappointed with the screen pixels and images.Camera quality is very poor Although note 3 has equipped with 16 megapixle but quality is really poor.Very poor camera quality its not worth 3.2 MP.Both cameras front and rear are of very ordinary quality.This is a grate phone in this price range..it is better then le2 and Lenovo k5 because i am using all this phone ..its display quality is awasam and battery back up also ,sound qualiy also very good.siply i suggest ordered this phone and enjoy.Nice phone... fast processing phone in low coast.... it's having large storage area..... Amazing camera quality...................... poor quality because in 2 days of buying touch started not working

First of all thanks to Flipkart & WS Retail, actually I was trying to buy this smartphone for the last one month or so from the other website (Am....), but every-time I get disappointed, then on 1st June on the very first day of the Open sale I saw Flipkart is selling this phone and guess who was the Seller, non other than WS Retail (I can blindly trust this seller), so I just ordered the 3gb/32gb (Gold) variant and I got this smartphone within 5 days of time and packaging was good as usual.HDR mode is a little slow and takes some time.Worthless product,gone dead after seven days' use.Since then wandering from pillar to post to get service done.Service center has done nothing till date except picking the product.Every time their readymade reply-product had not been send back from head office.This is the first Xiaomi product which is such a useless n troublesome 1.most of the people don't known that redmi note 3 can be undated to any upcoming versions of android once the xiaomi sends you the update after testing it xiaomi may take time to send you the update but it will be definitely send you whereas other companies phones have a upgradedation limit and and like apple redmi xioumi updates all the phones at once so no one is left behind I buy Redmi note 3,but after using 2 days it show problem like overheating, when u connected to wifi or mobile data it will automatically disconnected after sometime.I complain for over heating to flipkart Customer care and they send a technician and he told me mobile is normal, don't know in which parameter he told this.I again complain to flipkart but this time they told me i need to go service center.If i have such time they why i should buy any product online (because saving our time) ...Battery life mind blowing in full single charge it gives me almost 8hrs of screen on time with moderate use.first of all thank you flipkart for quick and well packed delivery.now coming to phone a high end phone with a nothing price.performance wise no lags at all.even keeps high end gaming in memory.best part about the phone is its battery .it lasts me hole single day even after heavy usage.charging time is fairly quick too.charge a 4000mah battery in 2hours only.So made a replacement request now got the other one but this time sim 1 is showing no signals and i have asked to Flipkart to replace it again so they are asking me to wait they will respond to my request.Very Disappointed by flipkart this time ... 4)This phone contains hybrid SIM slot,we cannot use both sims and sd card at a time.we can use one micro sim and one nano or sd card which is quite unsatisfactory.It can run several apps at a time, play high end games e.g. Cons: sound is bit high pitch, which you may sometime find to be uncomfortable while listening music in loud Awesome phone the phone gets fab for every update but if we use the 4g for more time the charging is draining little bit fastly But the product was great fallen two times and there is no small scratch on it.I am glad with this product after 4 days of use, first time I face few issue with finger sensor but the process which I have followed is wrong so tach a help from YouTube and do the same the finger sensor works good.Build and design 8/10 = its not full metalic, up and down there is some plastic and its not a tough metal, but for 12000/10000 rupees its enough to catch ur glimpse all the time,specially the golden color... its notification LED is rather dim, and again not a disappointment, has fairly strong screen protection as tough as gorilla glass and inhand feel is bit sleepery for its rounded edges...

Then please buy a dslr or buy a 40k rs phone instead but don't rate this device low.. battery performance doesn't meet the expectation, interface is the worst, camera captures photos with 2MP clarity, ram consumption is more with unnecessary pre loaded apps.So considering all these reasons, I started hunting for an android mobile with big screen, good battery and good performance which also support 4g VoLTE.

Flipkart customer care service is pathetic nowadays......asked me to go see a service centre....You should not sell the products if you can't exchange your faulty products.First of all thanks to Flipkart & WS Retail, actually I was trying to buy this smartphone for the last one month or so from the other website (Am....), but every-time I get disappointed, then on 1st June on the very first day of the Open sale I saw Flipkart is selling this phone and guess who was the Seller, non other than WS Retail (I can blindly trust this seller), so I just ordered the 3gb/32gb (Gold) variant and I got this smartphone within 5 days of time and packaging was good as usual.last 4 days have charged it only twice in spite of the heavy usage.If you a light user, it can even last up to 2 days.4000 MAH battery backup (easily last more than 1 day with average 4g usage) Great phone.no other phone have such great feature like this in this budget.i am giving 1 star because supercomnet seller ships it after 6 days from the date of order placed .worst service by supercomnet Worthless product,gone dead after seven days' use.Since then wandering from pillar to post to get service done.Service center has done nothing till date except picking the product.Every time their readymade reply-product had not been send back from head office.This is the first Xiaomi product which is such a useless n troublesome I buy Redmi note 3,but after using 2 days it show problem like overheating, when u connected to wifi or mobile data it will automatically disconnected after sometime.I complain for over heating to flipkart Customer care and they send a technician and he told me mobile is normal, don't know in which parameter he told this.I again complain to flipkart but this time they told me i need to go service center.If i have such time they why i should buy any product online (because saving our time) ...first of all thank you flipkart for quick and well packed delivery.now coming to phone a high end phone with a nothing price.performance wise no lags at all.even keeps high end gaming in memory.best part about the phone is its battery .it lasts me hole single day even after heavy usage.charging time is fairly quick too.charge a 4000mah battery in 2hours only.I m using this phone for last 9 days and i have to say that this phone got everything you need Flipkart delivered the product one day before the expected date of delivery after 4-5 days of the phone display and soft key not working, and i have to do quick restore .Though had a small glitch on 3rd day, with the touch screen...it was rectified after rebooting...working smoothly from then..I am glad with this product after 4 days of use, first time I face few issue with finger sensor but the process which I have followed is wrong so tach a help from YouTube and do the same the finger sensor works good.poor quality because in 2 days of buying touch started not working Screen broken within 3 days with a minor fall only, Screen is to weak, No Gorilla Glass here.

I bought It 3 month before, after 1 month suddenly its restarting and hangs up.So I went to service center , but their service centers are too bad, till now after 2 month I didn't get my phone back.Another main problem is heating.Restart and heating are the regular problem of this phone, I saw on their own site.As per my experience i found lots of people at service center with problems... and Post service is Horrible for MI.I buy Redmi note 3,but after using 2 days it show problem like overheating, when u connected to wifi or mobile data it will automatically disconnected after sometime.I complain for over heating to flipkart Customer care and they send a technician and he told me mobile is normal, don't know in which parameter he told this.I again complain to flipkart but this time they told me i need to go service center.If i have such time they why i should buy any product online (because saving our time) ...This was so unexpected that it took me a couple of days to find the cause of the problem.Till now now problem faced while using in last 12 hours fully .Hope value for money .only little heating problem is occurred in this phone.I had little problem with camera,where pics were getting blur,when I asked for return,as seller don't accepted return..so over phone a technician suggested to me to change camera setting,,n I did now its okay..If you go in roaming they donot show roaming notification (R) as shown by other mobile.This problem persist in all Xiaomi mobile.

The display has a slight bias towards blue, making it appear a tad more cooler than what we prefer.However, the extra colours and contrast tweaking options offered in the settings menu do come in handy in tweaking the colour tone of the display, as per preference.This is a grate phone in this price range..it is better then le2 and Lenovo k5 because i am using all this phone ..its display quality is awasam and battery back up also ,sound qualiy also very good.siply i suggest ordered this phone and enjoy.after 4-5 days of the phone display and soft key not working, and i have to do quick restore .Yellow tinge in display after 5 months of usage i recommend not to buy and the service is also very very poor will take months to repair coming with unsatisfactory results now i understood cheap phones are cheap in every aspect, 1 star is for that i cant rate it below that i will not recommend it

Light weight,100% authentic product from flipkart.After using almost 1month ,no hang,ho heating issue,good and clear -Camera works great in daylight both front and back but in low light you easily can see the noise in pictures but it is not that big issue, overall low light images are pretty good.Few words to those frndz who are facing so called battery heating issue, please update your RN3 SD with new MIUI 8 Global Beta ROM, definitely it will decrease your RN3 SD's battery heating problem and guyz MIUI 8 is really superb !I faced product hang issue.It becomes very hot while we charged the phone.look and other features are good.So far, have not faced any heating issues(Snapdragon 650 is a far more superior processor than the Mediatek one that Xiaomi used on the Note 3 models for China, so not really surprised).Secondly after using it for only 3 months, major hardware issue is popping out.phone getting band automatically and heating issue.i will suggest don't buy this phone.service center also not taking responsibility of technical issue.In this model, major issue is network setting, if we set network on 3 or 4G preffered then autometically shift on 2G even if 3G service is avaiable at that location, I personally compaired with 2 sim with same service provider TATA DOCOMO at Vasai location in Redmi 1s and HTC we received 3 G service but in this model Redmi note-3 run only 2G service full day, after that only I took decision to return this phone.Its is overall a good device but I faced some hardware issues I have only one issue with this phone that If we are using the memory card, that time we can use only single sim.I played in it asphalt 8, nova 3( nova 3 showed occasional lag, it doesn't lag in less stronger cpu and graphics than this, perhaps a compatibility issue), gta san andreas, modern combat, Godfire and many middle-end games..it only went warm but no heating, it doesn't overheat for never... Hope redmi team will fix this issue as soon as possible and also waiting for marshmallow update.Excellent phone at this price range.good battery back up and fast processor..no over heating issues till now

sub-par even for this price range, don't know if there is software or hardware issue , images taken with the flash have a weird yellow tone to them especially the skin tones looks like someone has applied haldi on them.Very very worst phone.. Good camera has many heating issues and phone is getting stuck many times.If you are doing rough use dont take this phn .I downloaded asphalt 8 in this phn and my phn software got crash .Heating issue is also there if u play games for long hour .This is not a gaming phone .Performance: Redmi offers a powerful Snapdragon 650 SoC coupled with 3GB RAM which handles daily tasks and moderate gaming without any issues.6)Regarding performance wise I took 3gb and 32 gb gold color phone.No lagging issues found.using from last 8 months but having no issues, if anyone want to buy a phone in price range of 12k then you can for sure choose Mi Redmi Note3 Only the charger heating issue, else as per expectations and other reviews referred....!!!No heating issue, people said in earlier reviews that there is a heating issue but i did not had such issue.I am glad with this product after 4 days of use, first time I face few issue with finger sensor but the process which I have followed is wrong so tach a help from YouTube and do the same the finger sensor works good.Phone is having heating issues, even during normal use.Some minor issues with MUI OS.

9.the phones proximity sensor oesnt work after the first update of the device ,but with time it gets fixed..The overall performance of the device is satisfactory.but it I faced some charging plugin problems it won't change in sometimes You can enable READ MODE when you are using the device at night / reading articles in a low-light environment.Even if your device is under water for 10 seconds, it works fine.I am using the ipaky case for Redmi note 3 which you may feel a bit heavy but it protects the device so well.But using the device continuously there was flickering in the display then I sent a mail with respective images.And about the device it's really good at this price segment.Battery backup good but remote aap fingerprint sensor quality not good remote aap ltd brand works have internet connet but letv mobile offline works total device i bought near about 45 days ago This device is absolutely stunning!!!!Its is overall a good device but I faced some hardware issues Those who are saying that camera performance is bad.. Then please buy a dslr or buy a 40k rs phone instead but don't rate this device low.. First of all its a complete value for money product, complete because none of its features compartments and parts will give u any dissatisfaction for the money u spent.. keeping it on mind I will briefly give the description of my thinking on every portion of this device Camera 8/10 = for sure I can say the front camera in it is very much impressive, the back camera is also very good if u don't compare it with a 20k 30k device, its better than many Sound through speaker 5/10 = sorry, this part isn't good.. well u cant expect all of the things best from a device, flaw is always there in something which is its speaker,,, well the ringtones and games sound enough loud but media and songs of the rest kind are pretty much average I would say less than average... but still it wont really get even a bit of the fulfilment and fun that u got from the device... And coming to device it's an awesome product from redmi, the device looks damn hot and superb design, I really like it's MIUI for its heavily customised OS, and also performance was awesome, it is best suitable for heavy apps users like students.Camera is the only one disappointment in this device, I heard that it was fine before miui updates later the update have ruined it's camera.After using 1month i am extremly satisfied with the device ( with flipkart as well) everything is fine and my mind blowing device work like a charm got miui 8 update on first boot great deal got it for 10001 rupees and my mind blowing device work like a charm got miui 8 update on first boot great deal got it for 10001 rupees This is pretty common issue with xiaomi devices from past 2 years.

In terms of form factor, it is well proportioned and is comfortable to use for a device with a 5.5-inch screen.The smartphone does look more premium in comparison to previous Redmi Note devices, but the extra smooth finish at the back makes it a bit slippery and prone to accidental falls.8.The miui is highly customissable and u can customise almost anything in the device such as notification light ,backlight I was so glad to have brought this device.Its so ridiculous that if they are not going to do to replace the device I will be forced to take legal action and will lodge consumer court complain too..

-Gaming performance is smooth you dont feel any lagging while playing heavy games 9.the phones proximity sensor oesnt work after the first update of the device ,but with time it gets fixed.. i also looked at others review like u r looking at mine but to be fare with u being friend , i recommend u to buy it as soon as u see it is available .. u might regret afterwards :) My darling is a true beast, but buy only in Flipkart not in www.mi.com, So I have used this phone for 15 days without giving any rest to it, and it becomes my darling now it never hangs atleast once throughout, and i heavily used both front and rear camera, camera was excellent, but in dim lights definitely photo quality is poor, samsung is good even in dim lights, but Samsung will hangs a lot, comes to gaming it's a Masterpiece, even a higher hand games will play like a butter even in max graphics settings, over 3g battery will drain fastly, but still you can use 3g continiously with gaming for more than 10 hours, overall it's excellent, Probably the best phone in this price segment....it offers a lot at this price point...charging time has also come down a lot.....it takes 1 hour 30 minutes to charge the phone....one word for this phone....it is incredibly awesome....looks quite attractive in hand....fingprint scanner is blazing fast in this phone....overall 9/10 for this product....a nice product from xiaomi..... MIUI, the MI user interface one of the most smooth, powerful & features packed android user interface, though I think ZenUI (ASUS) is far better in-terms of customization, also ZenUI is a very user friendly UI as well.Please do not buy any Xiaomi product unless it becomes absolutely necessary or the only valid option.Es phone ka camera itna ghatiya hai ki pucho mat yellow yellow photos aati hai aasi photos koi bhe 3000 ka phone he de dega to 12000 ka lene ki kya jarurat hai :( Redmi ne nerash kar diya muje muskil se phone mila tha 32GB or maza nhi aaya :( I hope Redmi apne dusare phones me es problem ko sahi kare yellow flash na lagaye or photos bhe sahi aaye :) Overall at this price segment it is a good phone with decent specs and premium looks whenever I plug the charger to mobile after 10-15 min it stops charging and the %of battery also goes down fast.I can say one thing that I surely bought a much better piece than iphone....a must buy phone...display quality and speakers are awesome...camera is good in every situation which is the most promising feature of this phone....go for it @ R's.But as time goes on u will find this is not at all a premium kind of phone.But a little disappointed because of the unavailability of gold colour one...actually I wanted that colour..I have to compromise with this silver one..:-(:-) features, packing and delivery was very nice...I am fully satisfied by ni note 3 features and built quality...thank u once again Flipkart and MI Below I have written my own observation and experience with this phone within a short span of one month (although I know it might be too early ;p ) Although the self declaration sticker at the back of the phone might be upsetting at first, but you can always get rid off them anyway.Fingerprint works totally fine... few small delights like one hand operation, remote, compass are icing on the cake... do insure with mi protect and dnt take the worry of puting a tempered glass or case...totally recommend this phone Nice phone with awesome features in the price range.especially battery perfomence too good.loving it.i want to purchance another red mi phone in a due course...thanq flipkart... Great product at best price and delivery as promised by Flipkart.---review made for the average buyers, for all my fellow indian brothers and sisters who are the middle class people of India who form the majority of population, for the people who work hard to make money and spend it on something worth the necessity and not just raw enjoyment--- First of all its a complete value for money product, complete because none of its features compartments and parts will give u any dissatisfaction for the money u spent.. keeping it on mind I will briefly give the description of my thinking on every portion of this device I played in it asphalt 8, nova 3( nova 3 showed occasional lag, it doesn't lag in less stronger cpu and graphics than this, perhaps a compatibility issue), gta san andreas, modern combat, Godfire and many middle-end games..it only went warm but no heating, it doesn't overheat for never...Redmi note not 3 good phone My second phone from mi stable, first one being mi4i.... Hope this will also keep up to the name 7. camara,,,, mi camera sony sensor used and it is 8/10,,coz cant give u 10 coz flagships will feel insulted :-p so buy the ph after agree with and knowing this..1st sim micro and 2nd is,, if want to use without sd card,,the nano sim..I Purchased the redmi note 3 last month its really super video and camera quality very god amazing clarity all video record and camera High definition and charge capacity is good I'm daily used mobile 8 hours continues in online charge reduced 60% I'm very hpy to purchase the mobile and flipkart delivery is Very good thank u for good mobile give to me convey my thanks for flipkart I used these Redmi note3 from 40days awesome phone no one can competete these phone in these range fantastic performance of xiamio Redmi note3 yayayaya Very nice mi Amazing performance... premium design.. with good power juice...

The service of Xiaomi in India is not that much good as all other big brands but still they are doing their level best to give the best, at least, they have exclusive service centers in India.Worthless product,gone dead after seven days' use.Since then wandering from pillar to post to get service done.Service center has done nothing till date except picking the product.Every time their readymade reply-product had not been send back from head office.This is the first Xiaomi product which is such a useless n troublesome If you are doing rough use dont take this phn .I downloaded asphalt 8 in this phn and my phn software got crash .Heating issue is also there if u play games for long hour .This is not a gaming phone .1.most of the people don't known that redmi note 3 can be undated to any upcoming versions of android once the xiaomi sends you the update after testing it xiaomi may take time to send you the update but it will be definitely send you whereas other companies phones have a upgradedation limit and and like apple redmi xioumi updates all the phones at once so no one is left behind I buy Redmi note 3,but after using 2 days it show problem like overheating, when u connected to wifi or mobile data it will automatically disconnected after sometime.I complain for over heating to flipkart Customer care and they send a technician and he told me mobile is normal, don't know in which parameter he told this.I again complain to flipkart but this time they told me i need to go service center.If i have such time they why i should buy any product online (because saving our time) ...Battery life mind blowing in full single charge it gives me almost 8hrs of screen on time with moderate use.My previous phone was Moto x2 so i do miss that infinite contrast of amoled though.This is my first Xiaomi phone, so i expected miui to be running flawlessly on it.first of all thank you flipkart for quick and well packed delivery.now coming to phone a high end phone with a nothing price.performance wise no lags at all.even keeps high end gaming in memory.best part about the phone is its battery .it lasts me hole single day even after heavy usage.charging time is fairly quick too.charge a 4000mah battery in 2hours only.Performance: Redmi offers a powerful Snapdragon 650 SoC coupled with 3GB RAM which handles daily tasks and moderate gaming without any issues.Only one Caution: The phone might start heating up while playing high graphics game.using from last 8 months but having no issues, if anyone want to buy a phone in price range of 12k then you can for sure choose Mi Redmi Note3 - The glass is not so protective and mine broken on the first week on a drop of just 2 feet.from bed to a wooden floor.Too bad Using a full day with moderate gaming and multimedia and some calls Iam getting 1 and half day charge.

Camera is great but average in low light.The phone is great value for money, only con i can point out is the cameras which perform very badly in low light conditions.Great phone.no other phone have such great feature like this in this budget.i am giving 1 star because supercomnet seller ships it after 6 days from the date of order placed .worst service by supercomnet But the product was great fallen two times and there is no small scratch on it.Other wise it was great product at this price.The standby battery life is quite great, the battery can last for 2 days.

Good screen quality got a faulty handset, touch screen is hanging alot Good cameras in daylight, nice touch screen, superfast fingerprint scanner and lots of options to customize the miui.Very simple and sleek design, Overall good build quality, fully metal made, available in many colors and only ~72.4% screen-to-body ratio.But in my case, as it has turned out, the front camera provides nothing but blurred screen and images.My phone is just perfect; it is the screen guard that made me fool.On one occasion i switched on Google voice's detect ok Google from any screen, and that resulted in muting my voice on all incoming phone calls.Display: Redmi offers a sharp Full HD screen.this mobile broken screen ricived so my bed luck.2.battery is marathon,, u cant drain within 1 day heavy usage,,give u 1.5 days heavy usage and screen on time 9 hrs 4.screen full hd so no need to tell,,have dragon glass protection I had RN3 32 gb gold version,which i purchased on second flash sale from mi store, but it fell down and got a crack on screen,but i was not happy with this minor crack bcz i love RN3,so i sold that to a friend of mine.And now i hv purchased my new RN3 32GB grey from FLIPKART,which i got 2 days before expected date,flipkart is very fast and provides good service.. as the mobile is awsome u can't get such mobile in this price group.So considering all these reasons, I started hunting for an android mobile with big screen, good battery and good performance which also support 4g VoLTE.Big screen The touch screen sensor is giving some problem else the set is very nice Once again a winner from Mi superb screen superb touch superb camera best in price range of 10 to 25k

In terms of form factor, it is well proportioned and is comfortable to use for a device with a 5.5-inch screen.The Sunlight Mode does work in terms of adjusting the contrast at pixel level under bright light conditions, but it doesn't make a huge difference when the screen is viewed under direct sunlight.cons: it's metallic body makes you feel the heat while charging or doing high end tasks but I have checked the temperature and it's nothing unusual; it's the metal body that makes you feel the heat, but also cools down soon after screen is off (just in a minute).Pathetic Camera quality, highly disappointed with the screen pixels and images.Battery life mind blowing in full single charge it gives me almost 8hrs of screen on time with moderate use.lot of new thing like one hand mode where you can minimize the screen up to 3.5, 4, 4.5 whatever you feel comfortable.Though had a small glitch on 3rd day, with the touch screen...it was rectified after rebooting...working smoothly from then..Build and design 8/10 = its not full metalic, up and down there is some plastic and its not a tough metal, but for 12000/10000 rupees its enough to catch ur glimpse all the time,specially the golden color... its notification LED is rather dim, and again not a disappointment, has fairly strong screen protection as tough as gorilla glass and inhand feel is bit sleepery for its rounded edges...It started hanging every now and then, its small screen started frustating me, the battery will drain in max 3 hours of use, and as always ios provides zero control for users.

The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is a highly recommended smartphone in its price segment, especially if you are looking for a smartphone that offers top notch performance and class-leading battery life.The 5.5-inch display on the Redmi Note 3 comes with Xiaomi's own glass protection layer, though it doesn't use the popular gorilla glass protection found in most smartphones today.Big 4050 mAh high-capacity battery coupled with power efficient Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 processor and the battery saving features of MIUI makes it one of the most longer battery life smartphone.Good smartphone from Xiaomi till date, loved it.Overall a very good smartphone at this price range....... You get almost everything a smartphone user needs without the help of any third-party apps.Big 4050 mAh high-capacity battery coupled with power efficient Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 processor and the battery saving features of MIUI makes it one of the most longer battery life smartphone.Redmi Note 3 is an awesome smartphone with only the LeEco Le 2 as a competitor in the price segement.Except camera this is beast smartphone .Even I can say it can be used atleast 1 1/2 to 2 years easily .Features and everything in this smartphone is nice wow it's amazing smartphone and thanks Flipkart for one day delivery.Nice smartphone with reasonable price My mobile never had an issue like hanging unlike my old Nokia Lumia 520 and Lenovo A600 ( worst smartphone I ever owned ) I have used a number of smartphones within 2 years from moto e, lenovo k3 note, meizu m2, moto g4..

The smartphone does look more premium in comparison to previous Redmi Note devices, but the extra smooth finish at the back makes it a bit slippery and prone to accidental falls.During our test, the glass appeared to be resistant to light scratches but the touch performance in terms of smoothness isn't the same as a smartphone with gorilla glass protection.First of all thanks to Flipkart & WS Retail, actually I was trying to buy this smartphone for the last one month or so from the other website (Am....), but every-time I get disappointed, then on 1st June on the very first day of the Open sale I saw Flipkart is selling this phone and guess who was the Seller, non other than WS Retail (I can blindly trust this seller), so I just ordered the 3gb/32gb (Gold) variant and I got this smartphone within 5 days of time and packaging was good as usual.For the last few years I've used many branded smartphones like, Nokia, Samsung, Asus, Micromax and this is the first time I'm using any MI smartphone and I must say, I'm really impressed with RN3.If anyone is looking for a budget smartphone with a Flagship like performance then don't think twice, just go for it, you will never get disappointed with your purchase.I'm using this RN3 SD for the past 1.5 month or so, I'm totally AMAZE with it's performance, this is the fastest smartphone I've ever used so far !!!Super smartphone but touch pad is very poor quality This is one of the best budget smartphone available with so many features to offer at such a lesser price when compared to other brands.Did a lot of research, and no other smartphone could come even closer.

No heating problem Good one, but i am facing heating issue while taking phone.some heating on charging time but all over best phone of this range and also i am suggest ing u purchase this product...thank you Light heating issue that too is not that much.I played in it asphalt 8, nova 3( nova 3 showed occasional lag, it doesn't lag in less stronger cpu and graphics than this, perhaps a compatibility issue), gta san andreas, modern combat, Godfire and many middle-end games..it only went warm but no heating, it doesn't overheat for never...Excellent phone at this price range.good battery back up and fast processor..no over heating issues till now

5.heating is there due to snapdragon and when u charge the phone as its normal as it I bought It 3 month before, after 1 month suddenly its restarting and hangs up.So I went to service center , but their service centers are too bad, till now after 2 month I didn't get my phone back.Another main problem is heating.Restart and heating are the regular problem of this phone, I saw on their own site.i updated the miui...still heating while charging...i use only whatsapp and shareit as extra apps...others are default apps in phone...Very very worst phone.. Good camera has many heating issues and phone is getting stuck many times.1 > The phone was heating very easily after playing normal games.I buy Redmi note 3,but after using 2 days it show problem like overheating, when u connected to wifi or mobile data it will automatically disconnected after sometime.I complain for over heating to flipkart Customer care and they send a technician and he told me mobile is normal, don't know in which parameter he told this.I again complain to flipkart but this time they told me i need to go service center.If i have such time they why i should buy any product online (because saving our time) ...There is slight heating on the top half only when playing games.Only one Caution: The phone might start heating up while playing high graphics game.Only the charger heating issue, else as per expectations and other reviews referred....!!!only little heating problem is occurred in this phone.Phone is having heating issues, even during normal use.

sub-par even for this price range, don't know if there is software or hardware issue , images taken with the flash have a weird yellow tone to them especially the skin tones looks like someone has applied haldi on them.The service of Xiaomi in India is not that much good as all other big brands but still they are doing their level best to give the best, at least, they have exclusive service centers in India.Great phone.no other phone have such great feature like this in this budget.i am giving 1 star because supercomnet seller ships it after 6 days from the date of order placed .worst service by supercomnet Worthless product,gone dead after seven days' use.Since then wandering from pillar to post to get service done.Service center has done nothing till date except picking the product.Every time their readymade reply-product had not been send back from head office.This is the first Xiaomi product which is such a useless n troublesome If you are doing rough use dont take this phn .I downloaded asphalt 8 in this phn and my phn software got crash .Heating issue is also there if u play games for long hour .This is not a gaming phone .don't listen to bad reviews and definitely buy this phone 1.most of the people don't known that redmi note 3 can be undated to any upcoming versions of android once the xiaomi sends you the update after testing it xiaomi may take time to send you the update but it will be definitely send you whereas other companies phones have a upgradedation limit and and like apple redmi xioumi updates all the phones at once so no one is left behind I buy Redmi note 3,but after using 2 days it show problem like overheating, when u connected to wifi or mobile data it will automatically disconnected after sometime.I complain for over heating to flipkart Customer care and they send a technician and he told me mobile is normal, don't know in which parameter he told this.I again complain to flipkart but this time they told me i need to go service center.If i have such time they why i should buy any product online (because saving our time) ...My previous phone was Moto x2 so i do miss that infinite contrast of amoled though.This is my first Xiaomi phone, so i expected miui to be running flawlessly on it.4-processor performs well even in tough high graphics games first of all thank you flipkart for quick and well packed delivery.now coming to phone a high end phone with a nothing price.performance wise no lags at all.even keeps high end gaming in memory.best part about the phone is its battery .it lasts me hole single day even after heavy usage.charging time is fairly quick too.charge a 4000mah battery in 2hours only.Performance: Redmi offers a powerful Snapdragon 650 SoC coupled with 3GB RAM which handles daily tasks and moderate gaming without any issues.I m using this phone for last 9 days and i have to say that this phone got everything you need Heard bad reviews about MIUI but i find it good enough for normal usage using from last 8 months but having no issues, if anyone want to buy a phone in price range of 12k then you can for sure choose Mi Redmi Note3 Pros: battery backup, features such as infrared, fingerprint, child lock, app lock, camera Cons: sound is bit high pitch, which you may sometime find to be uncomfortable while listening music in loud Awesome phone the phone gets fab for every update but if we use the 4g for more time the charging is draining little bit fastly Till now now problem faced while using in last 12 hours fully .Hope value for money .Speakers could have been better; Volume is very Low Only the charger heating issue, else as per expectations and other reviews referred....!!!

On the call quality front, we never faced any major call quality issues during our review of Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 - the voice reception and transmission were mostly glitch-free.-Camera works great in daylight both front and back but in low light you easily can see the noise in pictures but it is not that big issue, overall low light images are pretty good.So I have used this phone for 15 days without giving any rest to it, and it becomes my darling now it never hangs atleast once throughout, and i heavily used both front and rear camera, camera was excellent, but in dim lights definitely photo quality is poor, samsung is good even in dim lights, but Samsung will hangs a lot, comes to gaming it's a Masterpiece, even a higher hand games will play like a butter even in max graphics settings, over 3g battery will drain fastly, but still you can use 3g continiously with gaming for more than 10 hours, overall it's excellent, front cam works nice at night mode.Also not forgetting about the camera quality...which is just brilliant both front and back and offers great clarity.Silver looks like a typical Samsung phone from the front.But in my case, as it has turned out, the front camera provides nothing but blurred screen and images.I disregard the reviewers who says the camera quality is not good...the HDR quality pictures are really excellent ,much better than phones of this price range...the front camera is good for selfies but not good enough for selfie freaks...but you can always use an app for gorgeous editing...the 32 GB memory is a must need nowadays and the 3gb ram and it's powerful processor helps u play high definition games like asphalt and modern combat in a smooth pace...moreover the battery life is lovely...the flash is dual toned which helps u take good shots at night...the reading mode as in Kindle is a special feature of it which I love... connectivity,ringtone volume vibrations are all thumbs up :) ...the metallic finish is chick...overall it's a must buy set obviously if you get rid of the out of stock tag !!!5)I took pictures from both Rear and front cameras.Rear camera looks good and quality is as expected.The front facing camera (5MP) is excellent.the phone front camera is complient Camera 8/10 = for sure I can say the front camera in it is very much impressive, the back camera is also very good if u don't compare it with a 20k 30k device, its better than many Mobile options are good , no hanging problem but drawback is front camera is waste no use of selfiee , u need idea about camera clarity dont bye a this mobile



*******NEGATIVE REVIEWS*******
16MP rear camera | 5MP front camera is not bad as I read in other reviews.Only front camera and low light picture is not up to the mark, specially if you compared with Moto G 4 plus camera.i am a mi fan, but this phone really disappointed me in battery front, god knows how they are showing the battery is very powerful ..Camera quality is like an ordinary VGA camera both front and rear.Both cameras front and rear are of very ordinary quality.However, the absence of the front flash is disappointing about this phone and don't expect it to capture better selfies and pics under low light.

The smartphone does look more premium in comparison to previous Redmi Note devices, but the extra smooth finish at the back makes it a bit slippery and prone to accidental falls.If anyone is looking for a budget smartphone with a Flagship like performance then don't think twice, just go for it, you will never get disappointed with your purchase.sub-par even for this price range, don't know if there is software or hardware issue , images taken with the flash have a weird yellow tone to them especially the skin tones looks like someone has applied haldi on them.3GB ram and 1.8ghz snapdragon makes high end games look like a piece of cake and so far no lagging in between switching apps, Camera quality could have been better as i find it a little dull.The User Interface is Amazing, such a fluid Flat UI, this is what you're looking for.I ordered dark grey but more it look silver so that is little disappointing.No need to look at other options for this price range.

First of all thanks to Flipkart & WS Retail, actually I was trying to buy this smartphone for the last one month or so from the other website (Am....), but every-time I get disappointed, then on 1st June on the very first day of the Open sale I saw Flipkart is selling this phone and guess who was the Seller, non other than WS Retail (I can blindly trust this seller), so I just ordered the 3gb/32gb (Gold) variant and I got this smartphone within 5 days of time and packaging was good as usual.Only con is the camera...its really poor.... Another worse example of megapixel and clarity trade off... i updated the miui...still heating while charging...i use only whatsapp and shareit as extra apps...others are default apps in phone...i am a mi fan, but this phone really disappointed me in battery front, god knows how they are showing the battery is very powerful ..I buy Redmi note 3,but after using 2 days it show problem like overheating, when u connected to wifi or mobile data it will automatically disconnected after sometime.I complain for over heating to flipkart Customer care and they send a technician and he told me mobile is normal, don't know in which parameter he told this.I again complain to flipkart but this time they told me i need to go service center.If i have such time they why i should buy any product online (because saving our time) ...Gives the high end handset run for their value n budget .... Its so ridiculous that if they are not going to do to replace the device I will be forced to take legal action and will lodge consumer court complain too.. All good but Camera ...really disappointing when its a bit low Light.I have iPhone 6 so I dont want any other phone for camera... Not sure what is happening... my battery is draining fast... 1% battery loss= 3 mints mobile use in 4g + Flipkart surfing.....!It gets a little down at night.. Only the charger heating issue, else as per expectations and other reviews referred....!!!Though had a small glitch on 3rd day, with the touch screen...it was rectified after rebooting...working smoothly from then..

Good camera performance under normal light Average low-light camera performance -Camera works great in daylight both front and back but in low light you easily can see the noise in pictures but it is not that big issue, overall low light images are pretty good.So I have used this phone for 15 days without giving any rest to it, and it becomes my darling now it never hangs atleast once throughout, and i heavily used both front and rear camera, camera was excellent, but in dim lights definitely photo quality is poor, samsung is good even in dim lights, but Samsung will hangs a lot, comes to gaming it's a Masterpiece, even a higher hand games will play like a butter even in max graphics settings, over 3g battery will drain fastly, but still you can use 3g continiously with gaming for more than 10 hours, overall it's excellent, Focus processing is fast and good enough to click the beautiful snaps in daylight condition, also it has real time filters, but Yes in low-light condition it struggles a bit and after-all it's a mobile cam, so we can't expect a DSLR like quality from it.Good cameras in daylight, nice touch screen, superfast fingerprint scanner and lots of options to customize the miui.Full light photography is good and works well.Pictures took in light mode from rear camera is looks awesome.Slightly bigger for single hand operation Only good thing about this phone is its functioning under the Sunlight.You can have crystal clear view even in the Outside day light in the OPEN which is otherwise not possible in most of the smartphone Low light photos are not good to be frank.Display is awesome and exlent clarity in day light.Superb phone.........in starting there is battery issue....after updating the software resolve that issue....there is slightly Heat problem....while charging......performance is very good..........figerprint lock access is awesome........i am giving 4 star due to its Hybrid Sim Slot It's look is so sexy, but have one problem of slightly heating I'm using this phn for the past 3 days..love it..awesome camera...low light is a bit concern bt performance is surely satisfying.... awesome delivery from flipkart thank you flipkart Rare cam: awesome in day light, pathetic in low lighting conditions, but who cares.Fingerprint works totally fine... few small delights like one hand operation, remote, compass are icing on the cake... do insure with mi protect and dnt take the worry of puting a tempered glass or case...totally recommend this phone Display and other features- 10/10 = the display is one of its best charm, so vibrant and colorful..its the best display in this price range, good in sunlight too.

The Sunlight Mode does work in terms of adjusting the contrast at pixel level under bright light conditions, but it doesn't make a huge difference when the screen is viewed under direct sunlight.8.The miui is highly customissable and u can customise almost anything in the device such as notification light ,backlight Only front camera and low light picture is not up to the mark, specially if you compared with Moto G 4 plus camera.Low light images are of very poor quality and blurry.If you a light user, it can even last up to 2 days.The phone is great value for money, only con i can point out is the cameras which perform very badly in low light conditions.If you can do with the mediocre low light photography and the fixed internal memory(considering that you will use SIM in both slots), no other phone comes close to what Mi Note 3 offers.There is slight heating on the top half only when playing games.However, the absence of the front flash is disappointing about this phone and don't expect it to capture better selfies and pics under low light.The camera gives a high resolution picture even under moderate light conditions.For better clicks under low light conditions, you may try switching to HDD mode.

The best ph i ever used so far....got it before the day of delivery....and from then its running awesome...no lagging..fast charging.. And the battery life is so great So I have used this phone for 15 days without giving any rest to it, and it becomes my darling now it never hangs atleast once throughout, and i heavily used both front and rear camera, camera was excellent, but in dim lights definitely photo quality is poor, samsung is good even in dim lights, but Samsung will hangs a lot, comes to gaming it's a Masterpiece, even a higher hand games will play like a butter even in max graphics settings, over 3g battery will drain fastly, but still you can use 3g continiously with gaming for more than 10 hours, overall it's excellent, MIUI, the MI user interface one of the most smooth, powerful & features packed android user interface, though I think ZenUI (ASUS) is far better in-terms of customization, also ZenUI is a very user friendly UI as well.Display- 5/ 5( for me because its adjustable as yyou need and also automatically) Operating system - MIUI 8 - 5/5 (because no needs for downloading faltu apps as speed boster, antivirus or many others) Most of the features are very useful.. Was working like a faulty product...because it was draining a 30-40% bettary in a night, without Data or WiFi That said MiUI maynot be everyones cup of tea and may have to use launchers.You get almost everything a smartphone user needs without the help of any third-party apps.So far, have not faced any heating issues(Snapdragon 650 is a far more superior processor than the Mediatek one that Xiaomi used on the Note 3 models for China, so not really surprised).Few times fingerprint sensor does not work and have to use pattern.But a little disappointed because of the unavailability of gold colour one...actually I wanted that colour..I have to compromise with this silver one..:-(:-) features, packing and delivery was very nice...I am fully satisfied by ni note 3 features and built quality...thank u once again Flipkart and MI Dark silver colour is very attractive too... Heats up a little after continuous use of 45 mins to 1hr... IR blaster gives a good response... Don't think much and go for the phone!!Best battery backup n Easy to use I would recommend to use the charger given with the mobile itself...its only a suggestion.. Redmi Note 3 is just awesome and can't explain much about it because if you have thought of buying it, just don't think and click the buy now button.i have got the phone few days ago...n is amazed to use it.I have used a number of smartphones within 2 years from moto e, lenovo k3 note, meizu m2, moto g4.. First of all its a complete value for money product, complete because none of its features compartments and parts will give u any dissatisfaction for the money u spent.. keeping it on mind I will briefly give the description of my thinking on every portion of this device u can multitask with ease coz 1.7-1.9 gb ram is always available.. and the processor and graphics are better than many like used in lenovo zuk z1, moto g4 plus, lenovo k5 note,le eco le1s, huawei 5C Looking very good after 2days of use...can suggest this phone to everyone And coming to device it's an awesome product from redmi, the device looks damn hot and superb design, I really like it's MIUI for its heavily customised OS, and also performance was awesome, it is best suitable for heavy apps users like students.It's been 6 months since i bought this mobile and its the best mobile i have ever used Mobile options are good , no hanging problem but drawback is front camera is waste no use of selfiee , u need idea about camera clarity dont bye a this mobile I Purchased the redmi note 3 last month its really super video and camera quality very god amazing clarity all video record and camera High definition and charge capacity is good I'm daily used mobile 8 hours continues in online charge reduced 60% I'm very hpy to purchase the mobile and flipkart delivery is Very good thank u for good mobile give to me convey my thanks for flipkart I used these Redmi note3 from 40days awesome phone no one can competete these phone in these range fantastic performance of xiamio Redmi note3 yayayaya

i updated the miui...still heating while charging...i use only whatsapp and shareit as extra apps...others are default apps in phone... Heating- little bit while charging because its metal body.If you a light user, it can even last up to 2 days.If you can do with the mediocre low light photography and the fixed internal memory(considering that you will use SIM in both slots), no other phone comes close to what Mi Note 3 offers.Great phone.no other phone have such great feature like this in this budget.i am giving 1 star because supercomnet seller ships it after 6 days from the date of order placed .worst service by supercomnet Worthless product,gone dead after seven days' use.Since then wandering from pillar to post to get service done.Service center has done nothing till date except picking the product.Every time their readymade reply-product had not been send back from head office.This is the first Xiaomi product which is such a useless n troublesome If you are doing rough use dont take this phn .I downloaded asphalt 8 in this phn and my phn software got crash .Heating issue is also there if u play games for long hour .This is not a gaming phone .I buy Redmi note 3,but after using 2 days it show problem like overheating, when u connected to wifi or mobile data it will automatically disconnected after sometime.I complain for over heating to flipkart Customer care and they send a technician and he told me mobile is normal, don't know in which parameter he told this.I again complain to flipkart but this time they told me i need to go service center.If i have such time they why i should buy any product online (because saving our time) ...Battery life mind blowing in full single charge it gives me almost 8hrs of screen on time with moderate use.Awesome phone the phone gets fab for every update but if we use the 4g for more time the charging is draining little bit fastly If you are casual user then this mobile is for you but if you are advance user simply go for another mobile I need a secondary phone to use it on my Drone and to use few android apps since my primary mobile is an iPhone.- Heats a lot when I use hotspot and the battery drains out quickly when compared with normal usage ( Way after drain ) I am glad with this product after 4 days of use, first time I face few issue with finger sensor but the process which I have followed is wrong so tach a help from YouTube and do the same the finger sensor works good.Phone software not working properly with in a week from the day lam received the phone and agent close my replacement request with false statement provide me wrong advice just because of that I had submit my phone to service center and visit twice for the same very bad to use.It started hanging every now and then, its small screen started frustating me, the battery will drain in max 3 hours of use, and as always ios provides zero control for users.

Hopefully, this issue will be solved with a software update very soon.Very simple and sleek design, Overall good build quality, fully metal made, available in many colors and only ~72.4% screen-to-body ratio.Redmi Note 3 has clean MIUI(One of the full featured and best custom android) but K4 Note and Le 1s ships with a Bloated OS at times it lags.That Single Rating is also not needed to there services, I gifted diz mobile to ma MoM but it's not working, now imagine how our mothers feels after getting defective product as GIFT from child it's Hurting rite :'( I refer all my frnds not to trust diz site, they are making money by delivering defect mobiles to its customers, frnds dnt trust on der services nd the customer service is also not responding properly, intotal fully disappointed by der services nd the product delivered by Flipkart, Flipkart lost one customer.Now, it's the time for my full review.2.the display is full HD which looks very nice and crisp though it not having a gorilla glass but its display is 100 as strong as any gorilla glass 5.this phone is having a full metal body which gives it a premium look 1-This phones battery is best u can have on price band of 20k.when u fully charged it goes for 2days of full usage.I bought the this MI Redmi note 32 gb variant but seriously this time i am confused about the products what MI is making currently in bulk, as i when i got the phone it was fully discharged so connected charger to charge but didn't work but a bit charged.But a little disappointed because of the unavailability of gold colour one...actually I wanted that colour..I have to compromise with this silver one..:-(:-) features, packing and delivery was very nice...I am fully satisfied by ni note 3 features and built quality...thank u once again Flipkart and MI Its full metal body specifications are just superb.In this model, major issue is network setting, if we set network on 3 or 4G preffered then autometically shift on 2G even if 3G service is avaiable at that location, I personally compaired with 2 sim with same service provider TATA DOCOMO at Vasai location in Redmi 1s and HTC we received 3 G service but in this model Redmi note-3 run only 2G service full day, after that only I took decision to return this phone.4000 mAh but not upto mark to support full day, in HTC desire 600C battey capacity is only 1860 mAh which provide support full day even after full day internet service start.

So don't worry about its battery it will give a long losting backup up to 24 hours even you using its all your app open at a same time and it charges full 100 percent only in 2 hours.Battery life mind blowing in full single charge it gives me almost 8hrs of screen on time with moderate use.Till now now problem faced while using in last 12 hours fully .Hope value for money .Using a full day with moderate gaming and multimedia and some calls Iam getting 1 and half day charge.Build and design 8/10 = its not full metalic, up and down there is some plastic and its not a tough metal, but for 12000/10000 rupees its enough to catch ur glimpse all the time,specially the golden color... its notification LED is rather dim, and again not a disappointment, has fairly strong screen protection as tough as gorilla glass and inhand feel is bit sleepery for its rounded edges...Battery and Charging - 10/10 = the battery is beyond the best, it lasts for a full day with intense gaming and wifi and 4G usage..it shows no anomaly like excessive drainage, and the charging time is 1 and half hour to charge it full but its quite fast..

Average low-light camera performance -Camera works great in daylight both front and back but in low light you easily can see the noise in pictures but it is not that big issue, overall low light images are pretty good.OS - It runs with Lollipop android 5.1.1 version, which is pretty smooth and the good news is, YES RN3 will get the OTA update of Marshmallow 6.0.1 within this year, maybe around Sept - Oct, which is confirmed by MI.MIUI is the heavily customized android, and because of it takes ages to update their base, right now it MIUI 7.1 comes with the base of Android Lolipop and there will be a long wait for the Android Marshmallows.Es phone ka camera itna ghatiya hai ki pucho mat yellow yellow photos aati hai aasi photos koi bhe 3000 ka phone he de dega to 12000 ka lene ki kya jarurat hai :( Redmi ne nerash kar diya muje muskil se phone mila tha 32GB or maza nhi aaya :( I hope Redmi apne dusare phones me es problem ko sahi kare yellow flash na lagaye or photos bhe sahi aaye :) Camera quality is not good in low light situation Mobile is nice but following details I don't like...1) battery is not removable 2) memory card or SIM card...3) other accessories not available 4) headphone is not in box 5) original accessories not available on mi site 6) delivery on flipkart very late 3 days 7) camera is good 8) no metal body.Flipkart you are the best....got the phone delivered from bangalore to delhi in 18 hours flat...without opting for express delivery of any sought...regarding the phone I don't have to say anything..this is the 4th redmi note 3 I've bought...it's an almost perfect package..only gripe being the charge time is very slow..but considering my iphn 7 plus takes a whopping 3 hours 30 minutes to fill up a 2900 mah battery(2 hours 10 mins with an ipad charger) so I can digest the redmi note 3 taking less than that to top up a 4000mah one Good product at economical price,Internet speed is very slow even at 4G Location.Need to Remove one sim out of dual sim slot to insert Memory card is disgusting,Battery is irremovable also.Hai frnds plz not purchase this item isver low quality product 16 mp ccamera only name not good picture quality 1st time in life i bought phone below 15,000. in market many phones were available below and at 15,000 but choose for xiaomi redmi note 3 as my needs were performance, battery , decet UI which were all present in RN3 .I took 2 devices Positive and negetive that i found are listed below Below I have written my own observation and experience with this phone within a short span of one month (although I know it might be too early ;p ) The shade of the gold color is neither too loud nor too low.Believed the reviews, bought this phone, updated it, nw camera is like bullshit, its not focusing correctly, fingerprint sensor is bit slow on my phone.Good features in low budget I'm using this phn for the past 3 days..love it..awesome camera...low light is a bit concern bt performance is surely satisfying.... awesome delivery from flipkart thank you flipkart Rare cam: awesome in day light, pathetic in low lighting conditions, but who cares.Those who are saying that camera performance is bad.. Then please buy a dslr or buy a 40k rs phone instead but don't rate this device low.. ---review made for the average buyers, for all my fellow indian brothers and sisters who are the middle class people of India who form the majority of population, for the people who work hard to make money and spend it on something worth the necessity and not just raw enjoyment--- Hope redmi team will fix this issue as soon as possible and also waiting for marshmallow update.

Amazing camera quality...................... Software and UI- 10/10 = this is the one and only Android phone in this price range that will never make u feel bored...its user interface is the best, rich and catchy and smooooothest doesn't feel like regular Android so the need for marshmallow version won't turn you down..and actually all the extra preinstalled apps and bloatware u can delete in an instant Yellow tinge in display after 5 months of usage i recommend not to buy and the service is also very very poor will take months to repair coming with unsatisfactory results now i understood cheap phones are cheap in every aspect, 1 star is for that i cant rate it below that i will not recommend it

got a faulty handset, touch screen is hanging alot So I have used this phone for 15 days without giving any rest to it, and it becomes my darling now it never hangs atleast once throughout, and i heavily used both front and rear camera, camera was excellent, but in dim lights definitely photo quality is poor, samsung is good even in dim lights, but Samsung will hangs a lot, comes to gaming it's a Masterpiece, even a higher hand games will play like a butter even in max graphics settings, over 3g battery will drain fastly, but still you can use 3g continiously with gaming for more than 10 hours, overall it's excellent, Probably the best phone in this price segment....it offers a lot at this price point...charging time has also come down a lot.....it takes 1 hour 30 minutes to charge the phone....one word for this phone....it is incredibly awesome....looks quite attractive in hand....fingprint scanner is blazing fast in this phone....overall 9/10 for this product....a nice product from xiaomi.....Good cameras in daylight, nice touch screen, superfast fingerprint scanner and lots of options to customize the miui.Hybrid slot for the Micro SD and 2nd sim card.The phone cannot be opened at all, there is a sim slot on the left side to insert SIM/Memory card.Can't use dual sim if you are using memory card (2 slots 1 sim + 1 memory card or 1+1 sim) After few days hands-free slot problem occured It is having a lot of issues (majorly overheating and battery issue).Hybrid sim slot which means if you want to use 2 sim's you cannot use a memory card and if you want to use a memory card you can use only 1 sim but this is not a problem because most of the newly launched and upcoming phones are having hybrid slim slot and this phone is having a 32 gb internal memory from which 24.5 GB will be free for you to use which is sufficient to use Good product at economical price,Internet speed is very slow even at 4G Location.Need to Remove one sim out of dual sim slot to insert Memory card is disgusting,Battery is irremovable also.And you can go for a microSD card if needed, provided only one SIM is inserted as it has hybrid SIM slot.CONS : 1.Hybrid sim tray...32 gb is not just enough.a dedicated sd card slot would have been great.i read a lot- so read mode- cool, Videos are smooth but have lots of digital noise -No external memory card slot.Pros-- Dual sim and also have the Memory card slot.. so u can us it like one sim with SD card or Dual sim.. i heard lot of positive points about this product but for me it is very much disaster .... ****it will heat a lot in the first week of buying when u charge it, well it happens with all mobiles**** Good phone can be better if launched in 64gb 128gb variants or seperate data card slot rather than hybrid slot

Those who are giving 1 star and giving bad reviews are probably the owners of samsung, micromax, mototola, Lenovo etc etc with lot and lot's of stomach burning If you can do with the mediocre low light photography and the fixed internal memory(considering that you will use SIM in both slots), no other phone comes close to what Mi Note 3 offers.As per my experience i found lots of people at service center with problems... and Post service is Horrible for MI.But disappointed with hybrid sim slot lot of new thing like one hand mode where you can minimize the screen up to 3.5, 4, 4.5 whatever you feel comfortable.4)This phone contains hybrid SIM slot,we cannot use both sims and sd card at a time.we can use one micro sim and one nano or sd card which is quite unsatisfactory.Pictures that are captured are of more warmth, saturated a little heavy and light exposured a lot.Nice mobile and lot of options with low price..more efficient.- Heats a lot when I use hotspot and the battery drains out quickly when compared with normal usage ( Way after drain ) Did a lot of research, and no other smartphone could come even closer.

And coming to device it's an awesome product from redmi, the device looks damn hot and superb design, I really like it's MIUI for its heavily customised OS, and also performance was awesome, it is best suitable for heavy apps users like students.It's been 6 months since i bought this mobile and its the best mobile i have ever used The best phone in this price .features are awesome and battery is just perfect.So,just no more questions and got for it.Thanks REDMI for this wonderful fone.

Personally i don't think that this phone have any cons everything is fine if you really wanna buy this don't listen to anyone go for it.Rest everything is perfect.. u can pick it blindly That said MiUI maynot be everyones cup of tea and may have to use launchers.You get almost everything a smartphone user needs without the help of any third-party apps.Keep it up & make us happy everytime we ordered from you i got Red mi note 3,good but only one problems heated at the time of charging.also i find out this problem,everyone have mobile can "Airplane Mode" at the time of charging.the hand set is not working and getting hotter every day.I can say one thing that I surely bought a much better piece than iphone....a must buy phone...display quality and speakers are awesome...camera is good in every situation which is the most promising feature of this phone....go for it @ R's.Almost I am using from 5 months there is no problem everything is working very well and it depends on price ho much paying so In a such price we can not find such fantastic phone Hello everybody, please buy this product only if you have service centre near by,handset creating battery issue after using 5 months, not reliable product...got defected in fifteen days a must no to everybody.First of all its a complete value for money product, complete because none of its features compartments and parts will give u any dissatisfaction for the money u spent.. keeping it on mind I will briefly give the description of my thinking on every portion of this device Looking very good after 2days of use...can suggest this phone to everyone Device Is awesome.. everything works fine.. but only one con i am facing is speaker.. which is decent for the price.After using 1month i am extremly satisfied with the device ( with flipkart as well) everything is fine It's very very awesome product nd all of u know that MI handset we purchased its very difficult bcoz every time it's show out of stock so that reason we think that it's very awesome handset If you are looking for a mobile with every feature if todays tech its the most trusted of them

First of all thanks to Flipkart & WS Retail, actually I was trying to buy this smartphone for the last one month or so from the other website (Am....), but every-time I get disappointed, then on 1st June on the very first day of the Open sale I saw Flipkart is selling this phone and guess who was the Seller, non other than WS Retail (I can blindly trust this seller), so I just ordered the 3gb/32gb (Gold) variant and I got this smartphone within 5 days of time and packaging was good as usual.Service centers are not present everywhere.But other than that everything is amazing.It is best in every feature or other specifications I m using this phone for last 9 days and i have to say that this phone got everything you need Awesome phone the phone gets fab for every update but if we use the 4g for more time the charging is draining little bit fastly It started hanging every now and then, its small screen started frustating me, the battery will drain in max 3 hours of use, and as always ios provides zero control for users.Yellow tinge in display after 5 months of usage i recommend not to buy and the service is also very very poor will take months to repair coming with unsatisfactory results now i understood cheap phones are cheap in every aspect, 1 star is for that i cant rate it below that i will not recommend it

The smartphone does look more premium in comparison to previous Redmi Note devices, but the extra smooth finish at the back makes it a bit slippery and prone to accidental falls.But little bit heavy (164 g Steel ) Oh come on guys why don't you understand if you use any electronic gadgets to the high extent then it will Heat-up for sure and guys it has a metal outer body, so it will Heat-up a bit, Yes it also Heats up while you are charging, but when it reaches 70% charging level then it starts cool down and it's cool down really fast and I don't think it's a deal-breaker.Heating- little bit while charging because its metal body.All good but Camera ...really disappointing when its a bit low Light.Only bad thing was that Sim tray panel was a bit loose.Cons: sound is bit high pitch, which you may sometime find to be uncomfortable while listening music in loud Awesome phone the phone gets fab for every update but if we use the 4g for more time the charging is draining little bit fastly Build and design 8/10 = its not full metalic, up and down there is some plastic and its not a tough metal, but for 12000/10000 rupees its enough to catch ur glimpse all the time,specially the golden color... its notification LED is rather dim, and again not a disappointment, has fairly strong screen protection as tough as gorilla glass and inhand feel is bit sleepery for its rounded edges...

Gaming - I'm just a moderate gamer, played a few small games and didn't find any lags.Xiaomi beats all other old and big brands just because of their business model, price, quality, and MIUI.HDR mode is a little slow and takes some time.Google maps work in high accuracy mode Battery life mind blowing in full single charge it gives me almost 8hrs of screen on time with moderate use.lot of new thing like one hand mode where you can minimize the screen up to 3.5, 4, 4.5 whatever you feel comfortable.Performance: Redmi offers a powerful Snapdragon 650 SoC coupled with 3GB RAM which handles daily tasks and moderate gaming without any issues.The camera gives a high resolution picture even under moderate light conditions.For better clicks under low light conditions, you may try switching to HDD mode.Using a full day with moderate gaming and multimedia and some calls Iam getting 1 and half day charge.

If you a light user, it can even last up to 2 days.I'm a very heavy user and it doesn't last a day, but I plug it in whenever I'm in my room and it hasn't died out on me yet.3)Batter backup is good.I am using continuos for 6 hours I observed 45% battery was consumed.For normal users they can get 36 hours battery.If you are casual user then this mobile is for you but if you are advance user simply go for another mobile Software and UI- 10/10 = this is the one and only Android phone in this price range that will never make u feel bored...its user interface is the best, rich and catchy and smooooothest doesn't feel like regular Android so the need for marshmallow version won't turn you down..and actually all the extra preinstalled apps and bloatware u can delete in an instant It started hanging every now and then, its small screen started frustating me, the battery will drain in max 3 hours of use, and as always ios provides zero control for users.

Personally i don't think that this phone have any cons everything is fine if you really wanna buy this don't listen to anyone go for it.I'm happy with the phone, it is capable of shooting 4k, and does get warm sometime, but nothing to worry about !Rest everything is perfect.. u can pick it blindly Remote- its control anything ur tv ,set top box ,ac) Nothing much to say as already many of my note 3 frnds(those who already bought and reviewed in details) said so manh things about him.You get almost everything a smartphone user needs without the help of any third-party apps.Flipkart you are the best....got the phone delivered from bangalore to delhi in 18 hours flat...without opting for express delivery of any sought...regarding the phone I don't have to say anything..this is the 4th redmi note 3 I've bought...it's an almost perfect package..only gripe being the charge time is very slow..but considering my iphn 7 plus takes a whopping 3 hours 30 minutes to fill up a 2900 mah battery(2 hours 10 mins with an ipad charger) so I can digest the redmi note 3 taking less than that to top up a 4000mah one rest every thing is good as usually.Ear Phone not given as accessories as compared to the price of this product and other mobile product.its not worth for purchasing as per my openion.3.Look nd everything.. redmi note 3.. super fast processor.. great display, great battery, average camera ... and most of all things... its affordable .. n thanks to flipkart for fast delivery with nice packing.I can say one thing that I surely bought a much better piece than iphone....a must buy phone...display quality and speakers are awesome...camera is good in every situation which is the most promising feature of this phone....go for it @ R's.Only good thing about this phone is its functioning under the Sunlight.Everything is prefect Almost I am using from 5 months there is no problem everything is working very well and it depends on price ho much paying so In a such price we can not find such fantastic phone Only thing we have to be cautious about radiation....Chinese and other low cost smart phone gives great camera and.Features and everything in this smartphone is nice well not much to say its a champ phone by xiaomi...no wonder why they are breaking sales record, everything is perfect in this phone First things first, the look of the phone is amazing (Gold color).

8.The miui is highly customissable and u can customise almost anything in the device such as notification light ,backlight Yes the camera might not be in comparison to other phones in this price bracket but those phone barely get anything else right.But other than that everything is amazing.cons: it's metallic body makes you feel the heat while charging or doing high end tasks but I have checked the temperature and it's nothing unusual; it's the metal body that makes you feel the heat, but also cools down soon after screen is off (just in a minute).Worthless product,gone dead after seven days' use.Since then wandering from pillar to post to get service done.Service center has done nothing till date except picking the product.Every time their readymade reply-product had not been send back from head office.This is the first Xiaomi product which is such a useless n troublesome lot of new thing like one hand mode where you can minimize the screen up to 3.5, 4, 4.5 whatever you feel comfortable.first of all thank you flipkart for quick and well packed delivery.now coming to phone a high end phone with a nothing price.performance wise no lags at all.even keeps high end gaming in memory.best part about the phone is its battery .it lasts me hole single day even after heavy usage.charging time is fairly quick too.charge a 4000mah battery in 2hours only.The only one thing which made me disappointed is back camera.I m using this phone for last 9 days and i have to say that this phone got everything you need Only bad thing was that Sim tray panel was a bit loose.Nothing exceptional but nothing too bad either now the one and only bad things is- hybrid sim card and memory card technology,,means eiher 2nd sim or memory card u can use in 2nd sim tray!!!

So I have used this phone for 15 days without giving any rest to it, and it becomes my darling now it never hangs atleast once throughout, and i heavily used both front and rear camera, camera was excellent, but in dim lights definitely photo quality is poor, samsung is good even in dim lights, but Samsung will hangs a lot, comes to gaming it's a Masterpiece, even a higher hand games will play like a butter even in max graphics settings, over 3g battery will drain fastly, but still you can use 3g continiously with gaming for more than 10 hours, overall it's excellent, I also believed once that these low cost Chinese handsets would be bogus to buy and may suffer from many issues as I was brand specific and used only premium phones like nokia and samsung.

Few words to those frndz who are facing so called battery heating issue, please update your RN3 SD with new MIUI 8 Global Beta ROM, definitely it will decrease your RN3 SD's battery heating problem and guyz MIUI 8 is really superb !5.heat dissipation is brilliant :) and it doesn't overheats while delivering smooth as butter performance on high end games.So far, have not faced any heating issues(Snapdragon 650 is a far more superior processor than the Mediatek one that Xiaomi used on the Note 3 models for China, so not really surprised).i got Red mi note 3,good but only one problems heated at the time of charging.also i find out this problem,everyone have mobile can "Airplane Mode" at the time of charging.But noticing heat at times while charging and on using multiple apps usage.Very good battery backup and phone not getting heated up on opening multiple apps.It functions very smooth and gets a bit heat on high usage which you may notice.phone getting band automatically and heating issue.i will suggest don't buy this phone.service center also not taking responsibility of technical issue.some heating on charging time but all over best phone of this range and also i am suggest ing u purchase this product...thank you Light heating issue that too is not that much.Excellent phone at this price range.good battery back up and fast processor..no over heating issues till now

5.heating is there due to snapdragon and when u charge the phone as its normal as it I bought It 3 month before, after 1 month suddenly its restarting and hangs up.So I went to service center , but their service centers are too bad, till now after 2 month I didn't get my phone back.Another main problem is heating.Restart and heating are the regular problem of this phone, I saw on their own site.i updated the miui...still heating while charging...i use only whatsapp and shareit as extra apps...others are default apps in phone...But i do feel the handset heats up minimally while gaming.cons: it's metallic body makes you feel the heat while charging or doing high end tasks but I have checked the temperature and it's nothing unusual; it's the metal body that makes you feel the heat, but also cools down soon after screen is off (just in a minute).1 > The phone was heating very easily after playing normal games.I buy Redmi note 3,but after using 2 days it show problem like overheating, when u connected to wifi or mobile data it will automatically disconnected after sometime.I complain for over heating to flipkart Customer care and they send a technician and he told me mobile is normal, don't know in which parameter he told this.I again complain to flipkart but this time they told me i need to go service center.If i have such time they why i should buy any product online (because saving our time) ...There is slight heating on the top half only when playing games.Only one Caution: The phone might start heating up while playing high graphics game.Only the charger heating issue, else as per expectations and other reviews referred....!!!But heats up while charging which is quite common for other phones to.. as technocrats are doing some foul-play doing the product review of the phone, they mention that it never heats up but they are wrong.

posses a massive 4000mah battery.I reallly very happy with the phone battey 4000mah its like a power bank.Flipkart you are the best....got the phone delivered from bangalore to delhi in 18 hours flat...without opting for express delivery of any sought...regarding the phone I don't have to say anything..this is the 4th redmi note 3 I've bought...it's an almost perfect package..only gripe being the charge time is very slow..but considering my iphn 7 plus takes a whopping 3 hours 30 minutes to fill up a 2900 mah battery(2 hours 10 mins with an ipad charger) so I can digest the redmi note 3 taking less than that to top up a 4000mah one Big 4000 mah BATTERRYYYY... can take you all day long just on single charge.3gb ram, 5.5 inch hd screen and miui makes it best phone and yes 4000mah battery.beast undet 13k.I got the 3gb/32gb version... wanted the grey black but landed on silver white due to availability... but no regrets.this color looks premium too... have been using for past 4months...Battery stands for a day and half and sometimes with less usage even 2days... charges from 5% to 100% in around 2.5hours... which i felt is decent considering the massive 4050mah battery.on one hand it is massive with a capacity of over 4000 mah but the down side is, it heats up massively too!

Go for the Gold Variant 32gb, it has a premium look.Look n feel are very premium1.Overall at this price segment it is a good phone with decent specs and premium looks 5.this phone is having a full metal body which gives it a premium look Both phones offer a nice build quality but Le2 looks more premium and slimmer.I also believed once that these low cost Chinese handsets would be bogus to buy and may suffer from many issues as I was brand specific and used only premium phones like nokia and samsung.But as time goes on u will find this is not at all a premium kind of phone.Its kind of fancy so Redmi should not make publicity as it is premium.Look&feel:slim body, metal back, display... Over all a premium look.I got the 3gb/32gb version... wanted the grey black but landed on silver white due to availability... but no regrets.this color looks premium too... have been using for past 4months...Battery stands for a day and half and sometimes with less usage even 2days... charges from 5% to 100% in around 2.5hours... which i felt is decent considering the massive 4050mah battery.The big handy size, smooth butter touch, premium & elegance look and so much under 12k.Amazing performance... premium design.. with good power juice...

The smartphone does look more premium in comparison to previous Redmi Note devices, but the extra smooth finish at the back makes it a bit slippery and prone to accidental falls.

MIUI, the MI user interface one of the most smooth, powerful & features packed android user interface, though I think ZenUI (ASUS) is far better in-terms of customization, also ZenUI is a very user friendly UI as well.OS - It runs with Lollipop android 5.1.1 version, which is pretty smooth and the good news is, YES RN3 will get the OTA update of Marshmallow 6.0.1 within this year, maybe around Sept - Oct, which is confirmed by MI.Its been a week since I got a 32GBRedmi Note 3(dark Grey).The best part bout it is its look and the smooth touch...although I am not much comfy with the Mui7 platform it dosent enitrely give android lollipop feel.MIUI, the MI user interface one of the most customizable, powerful, features packed android user interface.MIUI is the heavily customized android, and because of it takes ages to update their base, right now it MIUI 7.1 comes with the base of Android Lolipop and there will be a long wait for the Android Marshmallows.Redmi Note 3 has clean MIUI(One of the full featured and best custom android) but K4 Note and Le 1s ships with a Bloated OS at times it lags.Now android marshmallow update is rolled out So considering all these reasons, I started hunting for an android mobile with big screen, good battery and good performance which also support 4g VoLTE.
