This project expects as input a flipkart url of whatever product you're interested in. The script then crawls through and collects all the reviews given by users till now on the site. Once this is done, this script analyses all the text and generates a list of 'features'. Then all these reviews are grouped according to the features. Primitive sentiment analysis is also done.

For example, if you're looking for a particular phone, based on user reviews the features that might be outputted would be 'screen' 'battery' 'display'. Sentimental analysis gives an indication of the number of positve and negative reviews for each feature. So this tool willl help the user to make a more informed choice about the product.

This is work in progress right now, expect mor commits in time to come.
